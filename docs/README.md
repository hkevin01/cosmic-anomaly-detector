# Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Cosmic Anomaly Detector project.

## Contents

- `api/` - API documentation
- `user_guide/` - User guides and tutorials
- `scientific_basis/` - Scientific background and methodology
- `development/` - Development guides and contributing information

## Quick Start

See `user_guide/quickstart.md` for getting started with the project.

## Scientific Background

The detection of artificial structures in space is based on several key principles:

1. **Gravitational Physics**: Natural objects follow predictable gravitational laws
2. **Thermodynamics**: Artificial structures may have unusual temperature signatures
3. **Geometric Analysis**: Perfectly regular shapes are unlikely in nature
4. **Spectral Analysis**: Artificial materials may have distinctive spectral signatures

## Contributing

Please read `development/contributing.md` for guidelines on contributing to the documentation.
